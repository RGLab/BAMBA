# BAMBA: Bayesian Analysis of Multiplexed Binding Antibody data

BAMBA is a package for fitting a grouped mixture model to BAMA or Fc
Array data in order to model immune response to various antigens in
immunological studies. The package fits the model via MCMC sampling
using the rstan package (http://mc-stan.org). Model results
include breadth scores summarizing subject immune response and
response calls for individual observations.
